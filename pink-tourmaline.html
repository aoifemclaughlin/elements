  Lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity. There are traces of lithium in the gemstone Pink Tourmaline. In recent years it has been used to make light, efficient batteries and is also used in air conditioners. Lithium has also been used as a medicine. When you take lithium it acts on nerves in your brain and changes the way you act.
