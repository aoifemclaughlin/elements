 Manganese (Mn) is a Transition Metal. It has an Atomic Number of 25. 
   This means there is 25 protons in the nucleus of the atom Manganese. <br /> <br />
   Not to be confused with Magnesium (Mg), Manganese was first discovered in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. <br /> <br />
   Manganese is a silvery-grey metal and is often found in minerals in combination with iron. There are traces of Manganese in the gemstone Kunzite.<br /> <br />
   Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steel (which is used to make knives and forks to eat your dinner!). Manganese is also used to make drinks cans, train tracks and prison bars (so that none of the metal rusts!)
