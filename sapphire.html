 Titanium (Ti) is a Transition Metal. It has an Atomic Number of 22. 
   This means there is 22 protons in the nucleus of the atom Titanium. <br /> <br />
   Titanium was first discovered in 1791 by William Gregor. <br /> <br />
   Titanium is a silvery grey-white metal. It has a low density and high stength. Traces are found in the gemstone Sapphire. <br /> <br />
   Titanium is resistant to rust in sea water and chlorine. Because titanium is so strong and so light it is great for making airplanes and it's also used for making paint. It can be found in rocks and minerals.
